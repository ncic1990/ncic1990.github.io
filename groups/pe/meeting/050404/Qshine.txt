SCOPE 
----- 

Recent technological developments in broadband high-speed networks,
peer-to-peer networks, wireless and mobile networks, and grid
computing have led to new challenging problems, such as providing
QoS support to the emerging multimedia applications across both wired
and wireless networks. This conference will focus on all aspects of
QoS support for heterogeneous wired and wireless networks with the theme
on cross-layer design. It will serve as a forum for researchers from both
electrical engineering and computer science to present latest research
results on QoS issues for both wired and wireless networks, with the
hope that electrical engineers and computer scientists will work
together to develop viable cross-layer design methodologies. The
conference will feature prominent invited speakers as well as papers by
top researchers in the field.

Papers addressing QoS support, ranging from the link layer to the
application layer, over wired and wireless networks are
solicited. Authors are encouraged to submit theoretical and/or
practical results of significance. The scope of the conference
includes, but is not limited to:

* QoS in WLAN, WPAN, WMAN and WiMAX (IEEE 802.11/15/16/20)
* QoS in wireless sensor and ad-hoc networks
* QoS in cellular and satellite networks
* QoS support across heterogeneous wired and wireless subnetworks
* MAC protocols with QoS support
* Scheduling, resource management, queue management, and admission control
* QoS in mobile environment, handoff
* QoS routing and mobile IP
* Traffic engineering and shaping
* MPLS and GMPLS
* Restoration and survivability
* Transport protocols for end-to-end QoS support
* Cross-layer error control and delay control
* Cross-layer optimization for energy, network lifetime, and capacity
* Topology control for QoS support in wireless networks
* Wireless multimedia applications/services
* QoS support with multi-mode radio
* Middleware for QoS support
* Security aspects of QoS systems
* QoS pricing and billing 
* Variable and adaptive QoS 
* QoS modeling and measurement 
* QoS and differentiated services architectures, protocols, and systems
* QoS specification, metrics, and analysis
* QoS in peer-to-peer, grid, and overlay networks

Accepted papers will be published in the conference
proceedings. Papers of particular merit will be selected for
consideration of a fast track publication in a special issue 
for ACM/Kluwer Wireless Networks (WINET) (approved) and 
a special section in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 
(pending approval).

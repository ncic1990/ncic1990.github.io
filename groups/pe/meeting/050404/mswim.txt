       Sponsored by ACM and IEEE (Pending approval)

   The Eigth International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and
   Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems

     October 10-13, 2005
       Montreal, Canada

      http://www.cs.unibo.it/mswim2005/


MSWiM is intended to provide an international forum for the
discussion and presentation of original ideas, recent
results and achievements by researchers, students, and
systems developers on issues and challenges related to
mobile and wireless systems.
Authors are encouraged to submit both theoretical and
practical results of significance on all aspects of
modeling, analysis and simulation of mobile computing and
wireless networks.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
   * Performance evaluation and modeling of mobile and
     wireless networks
   * Simulation and analysis of wireless protocols and mobile
     computing systems
   * Integrated simulation and measurement based evaluation
     of mobile and wireless systems
   * Survivability and reliability evaluation and modeling
   * QoS provisioning in wireless and mobile networks
   * Traffic measurements and models for audio, video,
     multimedia, and WWW services
   * New simulation tools for wireless systems
   * Database management systems and wireless data dissemination
   * Modeling and simulation of inter-vehicular networks
   * Wireless PANs and LANs
   * Ad hoc and sensor networks

The PERFORMANCE 2005 conference solicits papers on the 
development and application of state-of-the-art analytic, 
simulation, and measurement-based performance evaluation 
techniques. Topics of interest include, but are not 
limited to:

* Performance-oriented design and evaluation of:
  communication networks, mobile and wireless systems,
  Internet servers and E-commerce systems, Web services,
  Web architectures, peer-to-peer systems, grid computing,
  computer architectures, database systems, operating
  systems, software systems, distributed systems, 
  multimedia systems, file and I/O systems, memory
  systems, real-time systems, and fault-tolerant systems.

* Techniques and algorithms: analytic modeling, performance
  optimization, queueing analysis, stochastic scheduling,
  model verification and validation, power analysis, hybrid
  models, experimental design, system or network measurement
  and monitoring, workload characterization, simulation, 
  and statistical analysis.

** SUBMISSION GUIDELINES **

PAPERS: Papers should not exceed 22 double-spaced pages 
including figures, tables and references. PERFORMANCE 2005 
does not use a double-blind review process, authors should 
put their last names and affiliations on their papers. A

In case of problems, please send papers by email to 
papers.perf2005@sophia.inria.fr. Papers will be selected 
on the basis of their originality, technical standards, 
relevance and clarity. 

Full papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal 
Performance Evaluation (Elsevier) available at the conference.

TUTORIAL SESSIONS: Tutorial proposals, not exceeding 3 pages, 
have to include title, abstract, duration (1H30 or 3H), 
intended audience, assumed background of attendees, name, 
affiliation and a biographical sketch of the instructors. 
Proposals should be sent to the tutorials co-chairs
(tutorials.perf2005@sophia.inria.fr).

HOT/CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC SESSIONS: Proposals are solicited for 
a hot topic session, in which a group of speakers will present 
and discuss their recent results in an area. Send proposals to 
proposals.perf2005(at)sophia.inria.fr, identifying the organizer
of the session, the session title, three to five speakers, the 
titles of their talks, and a short abstract of each talk.

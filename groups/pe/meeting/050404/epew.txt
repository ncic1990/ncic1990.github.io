The European Performance Evaluation Workshop was held for the first
time in 2004 in Toledo (Spain) as a satellite workshop of FORTE. Due
to the success of this first edition, it has been decided to make EPEW
an annual event. This year, EPEW will be held in Versailles (France)
and will be collocated with the 2nd International workshop on Web
Services and Formal Methods (WS-FM'2005).


Scope
*****
This new forum aims to gather researchers working on all aspects of
performance modelling and analysis. We solicit original papers on
performance evaluation techniques for computer and telecommunication
systems analysis. Papers on or related to the following topics are
particularly welcome.

     * Performance-oriented design and analysis methods
     * Formal modelling paradigms: stochastic process algebra,
stochastic Petri nets, stochastic automata networks, Markov chains,
queueing theory,...
     * Solution and simplification techniques for Markov processes
     * Model checking and validation
     * Simulation techniques and experimental design
     * Performance tools
     * Performance case studies: communication networks, mobile and
wireless networks, software systems, distributed systems, system
architectures, grid computing,...

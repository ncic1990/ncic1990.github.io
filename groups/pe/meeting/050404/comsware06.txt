The convergence of the communications, information technologies and the 
Internet has ushered in a revolution in the way people communicate with 
each other. The key enabler for this convergence has been the 
advancement of software technology in various communication sectors, as 
evident by the high levels of activity in the industry, academia, and 
standards bodies, coupled with the increasing dependence of this 
convergence to sustain and improve growth rates in many countries around 
the world.

This new international conference will provide a forum to exchange 
ideas, techniques, and applications, discuss best practices and 
challenging issues, raise awareness and share experiences among 
researchers, practitioners, standard developers and policy makers in the 
field of software techniques in communications. The conference will
bring leading researchers and practitioners in areas ranging from 
communications software and software engineering aspects of 
communications software, to middleware and networking protocols. The 
objective of the conference is to provide a high degree of 
collaboration, participation and discussions of the various topics among
multi-national participants from the industrial, governmental and 
academic sectors.

COMSWARE will include a regular paper track and an industry track. The 
paper track will include a highly selective technical program. The 
conference solicits original, previously unpublished research work, 
experimental efforts, and practical experiences for the technical 
program. COMSWARE will also feature panel discussions from experts
in academia and industry, workshops and tutorials featuring the 
state-of-the-art in various communications software and related areas. 
There will be demos and exhibits that will expose the delegates to 
exciting products and software solutions from industry and academia. 
Accepted papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society. The top 
papers accepted to the conference will be published in a reputed journal.

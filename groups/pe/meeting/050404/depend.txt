===== 1st Workshop on Hot Topics in System Dependability =====

June 30, 2005, Yokohama, Japan
http://hotdep.stanford.edu/

Submission deadline: March 1, 2005

Dear Colleague:

You are invited to submit a 5-page position paper to the First
Workshop on Hot Topics in System Dependability (HotDep), which aims to
identify cutting-edge research ideas in dependable systems.  This
year, the workshop will be held jointly with DSN, the main conference
on fault-tolerant computing and networks.

HotDep will focus on critical components of the infrastructures
touching our everyday lives: operating systems, networking, security,
wide-area and enterprise-scale distributed systems, mobile computing,
compilers, and language design.  We seek participation and
contributions from both academic researchers and industry
practitioners, to achieve a mix of long-range research vision and
technology ideas anchored in immediate reality.

We encourage submissions of papers that describe a novel approach to
an old problem, debunk an entrenched perspective on dependability,
articulate a brand new perspective on existing problems in
dependability, or describe a new problem (and possible solution) that
should be addressed by the dependable systems research community.  We
favor papers that are likely to generate healthy debate at the
workshop.  All accepted papers will be available online prior to the
workshop and will be published in the supplement to the DSN
proceedings.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

* automated failure management
* techniques for better detection, diagnosis, or recovery from failures
* forensic tools for administrators and programmers
* techniques and metrics for quantifying dependability (e.g., security)
* tools/concepts/techniques for optimizing tradeoffs among availability, 
  performance, correctness, and security
* novel uses of technologies not originally intended for dependability

We are all looking forward to your submissions.

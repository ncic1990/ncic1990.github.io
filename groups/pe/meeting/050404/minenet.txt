 ******************************************************************

Today's IP networks are extensively instrumented for collecting a wealth
of information including traffic traces (e.g., packet or flow level
traces), control (e.g., router forwarding tables, BGP and OSPF updates),
and management (e.g., alarms, SNMP traps) data. The real challenge is to
process and analyze this vast amount of primarily unstructured
information and extract structures, relationships, and "higher level
knowledge" embedded in it and use it to aid network management and
operations. The goal of this one day workshop is to explore new
directions in network data collection, storage, and analysis techniques,
and their application to network monitoring, management, and
remediation. The workshop will provide a venue for researchers and
practitioners from different backgrounds, including networking, data
mining, machine learning, and statistics, to get together and
collaboratively approach this problem from their respective vantage
points.

We are soliciting original/position papers on topics (including, but not
limited to) listed below.

   - Collection, storage & access infrastructure: platform
     instrumentation (e.g. multi-modal, multi-resolution sensors),
     collection techniques (e.g. event sampling, filtering,
     aggregation, etc.), storage and access (e.g. retention policy,
     indexing techniques etc.).

   - Network data analytics techniques & tools: network stream mining,
     network graph mining, micro-clustering, temporal and statistical
     correlation, causality tracking, machine learning.

  -   Applications to network operations & management: network problem
     determination, network reliability and performance, root-cause
     analysis, security, emerging phenomenon detection (e.g. DDoS,
     virus/worm, spam etc.), traffic classification.

Of particular interest are (i) new solution techniques as well as
applications of existing techniques from data mining, machine learning
and statistics to IP network problems, (ii) experiences with the use of
such techniques for IP networks, and (iii) open networking problems and
challenges that would benefit from the use of such techniques. Selected
papers will be forward-looking, with impact and implications for both
operational networks and ongoing or future research.  

Submission Instructions

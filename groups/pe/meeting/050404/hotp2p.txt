 Second International Workshop on
           Hot Topics in Peer-to-Peer Systems (HOT-P2P 2005)

Scope and Interests
--------------------

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems are decentralized, self-organizing
distributed systems that cooperate to exchange data. These systems
have emerged as the dominant consumer of residential Internet
subscribers' bandwidth, and are being increasingly used in many
different application domains. In the last few years, research on P2P
systems has been quite intensive, and has produced remarkable results in
scalability, robustness, location, distributed storage, and system
measurements. Consequently, P2P systems continue to evolve,
differentiating today's state-of-the-art from earlier instantiations
such as Napster, KaZaA, Gnutella, and Morpheus.


This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners, from
both industry and academia, in the fields of systems, networking, and
theory, and to represent an occasion to share latest research results
and ideas on P2P systems, thereby promoting research activities in this
area. In addition to regular research papers to be selected on standard
peer review, the program of the workshop will include invited talks,
position papers, and panel discussions.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

	* P2P systems and infrastructures
	* Applications of P2P systems
	* Performance evaluation of P2P systems
	* Workload characterization for P2P systems
	* Trust and Security issues in P2P systems
	* Network support for P2P systems
	* Protocols for resource managements/discovery/scheduling and their
evaluation
	* Fault tolerance in P2P systems
	* DHT and other scalable lookup algorithms
	* P2P and autonomic computing
	* P2P systems and Grids

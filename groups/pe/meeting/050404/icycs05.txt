The emergence of new technologies, such as wireless and sensor networks, GRID computing, ubiquitous and self-organized Internet, ad hoc networks, etc., in recent years 
is exerting an incredible influence on our society and is changing the way in which people work and live. Information Technology has become a main focus and the 
mainstream of research and development in the academic community as well as the driving force for the development of new industrial and consumer products. 
Building on the success of past conferences, the 8th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists (ICYCS'05), one of the ICYCS conference series 
sponsored by the China Computer Federation, will be held in Beijing, China, September 20-22, 2005.
 
The theme of ICYCS'05 is: Convergence of computing technologies in the new era. Following the tradition and success of previous ICYCS conferences in the series which 
were held in Harbin, Beijing, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Xi'an, etc., ICYCS'05 will emphasize on the emerging new technologies as well as on the interdisciplinary efforts in the 
broad field of computer science and technology. The conference will provide an open forum for researchers from academic, industrial and related fields to exchange 
different views and share the latest achievements and experiences in the research and development in the broad areas of computer science and technology. 
ICYCS'05 invites the submission of original papers addressing the broad areas of computer science and technology. Papers describing recent advances in emerging 
technologies are especially welcome. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

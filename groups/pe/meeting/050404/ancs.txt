----------------------------------------------------------------------

ANCS is new research conference that focuses on the design of the
hardware and software components used to create modern communication
networks. The combination of increasing network line speeds and
expanding functional requirements pose continuing and growing
challenges for system designers. New technology elements, including
network processors, content addressable memories, configurable logic
and special-purpose components offer new opportunities for meeting
these challenges, but also raise a variety of new issues. ANCS focuses
on architectures for networking and communication in the broad sense,
including novel architectures, architectural support for advanced
communication, algorithms and protocols for advanced architectures,
software and applications for next-generation networking
architectures, and methodology and benchmarking for evaluating
advanced communication architectures.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Network/communications processors
* Intelligent co-processors 
* Router architectures
* Switch fabrics/interconnection networks
* Link scheduling, processor/thread scheduling, switch scheduling
* Network adaptors
* Application-specific networks (e.g. SAN)
* Programmable /extensible networks
* Secure communication
* Traffic management
* Packet classification
* Content inspection and filtering
* Energy-efficient designs 

We particularly encourage submissions containing highly original
ideas. Submissions will be judged on originality, significance,
interest, clarity, and correctness.

The PAPER DEADLINE for submissions is May 9, 2005 at 11:59PM PST
(US). NO FURTHER EXTENSIONS WILL BE GRANTED. ANCS will use
double-blind reviewing, so submitted papers should not include the
authors' names. All papers must be submitted electronically, in PDF
format for letter-size paper. Submissions must be viewable by Adobe
Acrobat Reader (version 5.0 or higher) and should not exceed 7,000
words or 10 pages of conference paper format using 10 pt
fonts. Submissions exceeding the required limit will not be reviewed
by the program committee. Detailed submission instructions will be
available by April 1, 2005 at: http://www.ancsconf.org.

Like other conferences, ANCS requires that papers not be submitted
simultaneously to any other conferences or publications, that
submissions not be previously published, and that accepted papers not
be subsequently published elsewhere.

All submissions will be acknowledged by July 30, 2002. If your
submission is not acknowledged by this date, please contact the
program chairs promptly at ancsPCchairs@arl.wustl.edu.

Important Dates

Submission deadline: May 9, 2005
Author notification: July 30, 2005

Tutorials

A series of tutorials will be held immediately preceding the
symposium. Tutorial proposals will be accepted until June 30, 2005. If
you wish to give a tutorial (1/2 or 1 day), email a proposal to the
Tutorials Chair (Erik Johnson, Erik.Johnson@intel.com). For tutorials,
the proposal must include title, brief description of topics to be
covered, and bio of the speakers.

SenMetrics 2005

Third International Workshop on Measurement, Modeling, 
and Performance Analysis of Wireless Sensor Networks 

San Diego, CA, USA
July 21, 2005

(in conjunction with MobiQuitous 2005)

http://www.senmetrics.org/
E-mail: senmetrics@ece.osu.edu


The SenMetrics workshop solicits papers on the development 
and application of analytic, simulation, prototype testbed, 
and measurement-based performance evaluation techniques to 
the area of wireless sensor networks. Of particular interest 
is work that furthers the state-of-the-art in performance 
evaluation methods, or those that creatively apply 
previously developed methods to understand or to gain 
important insights into key design trade-offs in wireless 
sensor networks. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
 
Performance-oriented design and evaluation studies of:
- wireless sensor networks
- sensor node hardware and software architectures
- data collection
- addressing 
- security, reliability, and robustness
- operating systems
- energy aware network protocols
- applications
- localization
- fundamental limits and tradeoffs
- topology management
- deployment
- distributed actuation and control
- system development and testbed experience
- benchmarks

Performance methodology techniques and algorithms for: 
- system, protocol, and algorithm modeling
- analytic evaluation
- system measurement and monitoring
- model verification and validation
- workload characterization
- simulation
- statistical analysis
- stochastic modeling 
- experimental design
- reliability analysis
- performance optimization


IMPORTANT DATES:

Paper Submission Deadline: April 15, 2005

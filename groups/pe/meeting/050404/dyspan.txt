Renaissance Harborplace Hotel
Baltimore Harbor, Maryland, USA

SPONSORS:

VISION:

The IEEE DySPAN 2005 will be a new, first-of-its-kind IEEE symposium
on "Dynamic Spectrum Access" (DSA) networks.  Current technology
trends indicate that high performance, low-power signal processing,
reconfigurable RF front ends, wide-band spectrum sensing and real-time
spectrum allocation and acquisition will enable a new paradigm of DSA
Networks.  In addition, the spectrum policy community (both
international and domestic) has clearly recognized the potential of
this technology and is addressing its impact on 21st Century spectrum
management by adopting flexible, market-based policies and rules for
  unlicensed devices and licensed radio systems. This is therefore an
opportune time to have a single, premier forum that brings together a
broad range of representatives, researchers, practitioners and policy
makers from industry, academia, and government from around the globe
who are engaged in cutting edge explorations in technology, policies
and legal aspects of emerging DSA networks.

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------

DySPAN 2005 is soliciting following types of contributions that will
be published in a paper proceedings published by IEEE and made
available to conference registrants.

  FULL PAPERS: Full Papers in technology and policy domain must present
	  original, previously unpublished, complete works. Papers in
	  technology track presenting research experiences from
	  realistic systems are welcome. The extended abstracts that
	  are accepted need to be expanded to full papers under the
	  guidance of program committee members.

POSITION PAPERS: These papers must be innovative and forward-looking
	  and must offer new insights that show promise of pointing
	  out future research directions.

In addition to these, DySPAN2005 may include a few invited papers from
leading members of technology and policy community.

Following page limits will be followed.

       Technology Track:
       ----------------
	 Maximum 6 pages excluding figures, tables, and reference for
          Extended Abstract

          Maximum 10 page for final paper, including figures, tables,
	 and references

       Policy track:
       -------------
	  Maximum 20 pages excluding figures, tables, and reference
           for Extended Abstract

           Maximum 30 pages including figures, tables, references for
	  the final papers

       Position papers:
       ----------------
       		Maximum 10 pages for Technology track including
       		figures, tables, references

       		Maximum 20 pages for Policy track including figures,
       		tables, references

We recommend to format manuscripts according to the IEEE double-column
standard format. Extended abstracts should use Times Roman 11pt (or
greater) font. The final published manuscript will use Times Roman
10pt font. Authors should use only standard fonts, i.e., Times Roman,
Courier, Symbol, and Helvetica, or equivalent. Formatting guidelines
and template support for popular word processing packages (MS-WORD,
LaTeX) will be available on http://www.ieee-dyspan.org.

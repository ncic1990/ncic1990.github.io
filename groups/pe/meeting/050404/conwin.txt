Scope of ConWiN 2005:
=====================

The advances  in the wireless communication technologies  have enabled
the  realization of wide range of heterogeneous wireless networks from
wireless  local area networks (WLANs),  several generations (2G/3G) of
wireless  cellular  networks  to  mobile  ad hoc networks (MANET)  and
wireless  sensor  networks  (WSN).  This  technological  evolution  is
further inspiring researchers to envision the next generation wireless
networking architectures and even the space Internet.

Next Generation Wireless Internet (NGWI)  will  be  the convergence of
these heterogeneous wireless networks and the next generation Internet
to provide  mobile users with a wide range of high  resource demanding
services  such  as  high speed reliable data  and real-time multimedia
delivery. While the  unique characteristics  of each of these wireless
networks pose diverse  set of challenges,  their integration  severely
expands the set of open research problems for seamless, efficient, and
reliable  communication.  Therefore, there exists an urgent need for a
significant research effort  to focus on  solving these new challenges
posed  by  the integration  and  the  convergence  of  these  wireless
heterogeneous networks.

The objective of ConWiN 2005 is to  provide  a research platform where
researchers  bring their  contributions  to light  by presenting their
technical papers  on  the  issues  regarding  the  integration and the
convergence  of  heterogeneous  wireless networks. Papers solicited in
ConWiN 2005  spans a wide range  of  areas  of  interest including but
not limited to:

- Physical layer issues for  the convergence of heterogeneous wireless
  communication technologies

- Novel  and  adaptive  communication  protocols  at all layers, i.e.,
  MAC layer problems, routing,  reliable and multimedia transport, for
  integration of diverse wireless systems  such as WLANs, 3G, and WSNs

- Novel and practical  communication architectures for the convergence
  of heterogeneous wireless networks

- Efficient mobility/handoff management protocols for seamless roaming
  within the converged communication architecture

- Killer  applications/services  for the convergence  towards the NGWI

- Security,  authentication,  and  billing solutions for the converged
  architecture

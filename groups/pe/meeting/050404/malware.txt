The emergence of malware such as worms and viruses has generated a widespread response from the research community in methodologies and tools for measuring, modeling, and simulating malware behavior, and proposed systems that detect, react, and prevent it. The 2005 Symposium on Measurement, Modeling and Simulation of Malware aims to bring together researchers in this important area, for the sharing of ideas and development of collaborative efforts.

We solicit short papers (4-8 pages) on topics including but not limited to

    * observation/measurement of malware behavior
    * measurement-based detection of malware
    * analytic models of malware behavior and its effect on infrastructure
    * analytic models of counter-measures, their effectiveness, and their impact on infrastructure
    * simulation methodologies for studying malware
    * measurement/simulation case studies

The Symposium will be as a track within the 2005 Workshop on Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation, in Monterey, CA, June 1-3, 2005. We will be meeting at the Portola Plaza Hotel, on Monterey Bay, a stone's throw from Fisherman's Wharf.

Papers will be refereed; accepted papers will appear in bound proceedings. Extended versions of outstanding papers may be included in a special issue of ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation devoted to Malware Modeling and Simulation.

Important Dates:

    * March 15, 2005 - paper submissions due
    * April 15, 2005 - acceptance notification
    * May 15, 2005 - final paper and registration deadline

Papers should be emailed to Professor David Nicol at nicol@crhc.uiuc.edu

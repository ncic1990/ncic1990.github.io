CALL FOR PAPER

Developments in computing and sensing hardware and in wireless communications have 
made it technologically feasible and economically viable to develop low-power sensor 
nodes that integrate general-purpose computing with multi-purpose sensing and 
wireless communications capabilities. Aggregating sensor nodes into sophisticated 
sensing, computational and communication infrastructures to form wireless sensor 
networks will have a significant impact on a wide array of applications ranging 
from military, to scientific, to industrial, to health-care, to domestic, 
establishing ubiquitous computing that will pervade society redefining the way 
in which we live and work. 

This minitrack focuses on fundamental challenges arising in the design of wireless 
sensor networks and their applications. Our goal is to offer a forum for high caliber 
research and experimentation in this booming area. We will provide the participants 
with an up-to-date survey on wireless sensor networks and applications. 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Sensor-based systems and applications
* Visualization of sensor data 
* Middleware and software tools
* Data gathering, aggregation and dissemination
* Embedded network-oriented operating systems
* Networking architectures and protocols
* Hardware aspects of sensor design
* Self-organization and governance
* Location and mobility management
* Topology control and time synchronization
* Power Management and energy-efficient design
* Cross-layer architectures
* Intelligent sensors
* Security and dependability issues
* Scalability of wireless sensor networks
* Interfacing with other wireless/mobile systems
* Work models for wireless sensor networks
* Modeling and performance evaluation
* Implementation experience and measurements
* Demos and prototypes


PAPER SUBMISSION

1. Manuscript submission is a two-steps process. By April 15, 2005, the authors are 
   expected to submit a 300-word abstract to the minitrack co-chairs for guidance and 
   indication of appropriate content. By June 15, 2005 the authors submit the full 
   manuscript. All the submissions will undergo a rigorous peer review.

2. For the submission of the full manuscript the authors must follow the instructions 
   available on the HICSS-39 web site (http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/HICSS39/apahome39.htm).

3. The manuscript should be no longer than 25 double-spaced pages, including figures, 
   tables, etc. (the final paper will be 10 pages, double-column, single-spaced.)

4. The manuscripts are submitted with the understanding that the material therein is 
   original, and neither previously published  nor currently submitted for consideration 
   elsewhere.

5. Each manuscript must have a title page to include title of the paper, full name of 
   all authors, and complete addresses including affiliation(s), telephone number(s) 
   and e-mail address(es).

6. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to attend the conference 
   (by September 15, 2005).

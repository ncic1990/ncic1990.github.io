<H2>R&D Experiences<BR></H2>
  <h3> Memory Box </h3>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory box is key part of  DSAG architecture and focuses on memory hiararchy problems.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  In today's computer architecture, CPU and memory are tight-coupled. This results in many difficulties. First, 
in some computer memory is idle, but others are out of memory, and they cannot share; second, memory crash  will result 
in the whole system becomes invalid; third, memory upgrade always encounters compatibility problem, some memory dimm
cannot used by other mainboards.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory box depart some memory from CPU and congregate them to a rack or box, to provide  memory service, we call it 
Remote Memory Box(RMB). First, it's highly shared and dynamic, and client host can get as possible as more memory from it; 
it has high bandwidth communication channel and support scalable  client number; It can hide the difference of vary memory modules,
providing uniformed access interface; memory capacity is scalable; easy to adapt different kinds of memroy module, without
change the architecure. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be used as swap device instead of harddisk; as quick checkpoint device; support process migration application; speed up DSM
system.<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this new architecture brings new challenges. We will give approach to solve this problems.

  <h3> Reconfigurable Optical Interconnect System</h3>
  <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raindrop System, name of our optical interconnet evaluation system, is one of the fundamental parts of DSAG. The Raindrop uses DDR interface as commmunication channel with computer system, and uses FPGA to implement DDR control logic. RocketIO Multi-Gbit tranceivers in Xilinx FPGA are used for high speed transmit and receive logic. 12-way VCSEL electronic-optical and PIN optical-electronic modules are used for optical interconnect. With DDR266 and 12 RocketIO transceivers, the total bandwith can reach 25Gb.

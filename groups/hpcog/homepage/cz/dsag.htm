</font><p><font size="3" face="Arial">The traditional high performance computer (HPC) architecture is facing</font><font size="3" face="Arial"> innovation. <br>
      The design and running models of application, reconfigurable computing, grid and<br>
      optical interconnection will impact the future architecture of HPC deeply.</font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial"> In this
      article the dynamic self-organized architecture based on grid component (DSAG)<br>
      is presented. DSAG is based on the concept of de-clustering, that is to divide the<br>
      different functional component of a traditional computer apart and reorganize them<br>
      dynamically. The separated functional components (grid-components) provide <br>
      service independently via optical interconnection network. Then the HPC system<br>
      will be built with grid-components dynamically according to the  application <br>
    requirements . </font>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial">DSAG will enable very large scale HPC system to be built. Based<br>
      on DASG a new HPC design model - "architecture on demand" is presented. In <br>
      this model the architecture will be adjusted corresponding to the application <br>
      characteristics instead of rewriting program to adapt to architecture change. The <br>
      supporting optic technology and operating system for DSAG are discussed. Other<br>
  levels system design that may apply the DSAG concept are presented program. </font></td>

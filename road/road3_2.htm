                          HPC-Asia, a conference series focusing on developments 
                          in advanced and high performance computing in the Asia-Pacific 
                          region, held its fourth conference/exhibition,May 14-17 
                          2000, at the Friendship Hotel in Beijing China. Convened 
                          approximately every 18 months, previous HPC-Asia’s have 
                          occurred in Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore. Beginning 
                          in the mid 1990s, an international steering committee 
                          recognized that there was a need for an Asia-based counterpart 
                          to the highly successful SC’XX series of conferences 
                          that are held annually in the US. Some themes are common 
                          across Asia, including interest in using modeling and 
                          simulation to aid in the solution and management of 
                          environmental and weather-related problems, the need 
                          to effectively utilize and aggregate distributed computing 
                          resources, human capital development, industrial growth, 
                          and of course, the impact of the Internet on all components 
                          of society. Issues that are viewed as front burner in 
                          the US, such as Petaflops and ASCI, are hardly noted 
                          in Asia (except possibly in Japan), where HPC has a 
                          very different meaning in say Bangkok than it does in 
                          Boston. While Japan is an obvious candidate for the 
                          primary venue, the committee decided that it was important 
                          to encourage the growth of HPC elsewhere in Asia, and 
                          especially in less developed countries. This involves 
                          building a human network of scientific, industrial, 
                          and business users. Conference organization and major 
                          decisions are guided by the steering committee but actual 
                          arrangements are the responsibility of the local organizers, 
                          who are selected by committee vote. Emphasizing HPC-Asia 
                          as a regional event leads to good cooperation and participation 
                          beyond the host country.</p>
                        <p>This year’s conference generated over 400 paper submissions 
                          from authors in five continents. Registration and exhibition 
                          walk-ins totaled about one thousand. The adjacent exhibition 
                          included about a dozen and half exhibitors from China, 
                          US, Korea, Taiwan, UK, and Japan. In addition to parallel 
                          technical sessions, the conference also featured Tutorials, 
                          Keynotes, Plenary Speeches, a Roundtable on Centers 
                          and Grid Computing., and several workshops, including 
                          on Cluster Computing, Scientific Computation &amp; Software, 
                          and HPC pplications. Conference interest was enhanced 
                          by the participation of several well known researchers, 
                          including Boris Babayan, Gordon Bell, Jack Dongarra, 
                          Ian Foster, William Pulleyblank, Richard Stallman, and 
                          Thomas Sterling. Special vendor tracks included presentations 
                          by key technical representatives from international 
                          companies including Compaq, HP, IBM, SGI, Sun　Microsystems, 
                          and Unisys, as well as from smaller local and regional 
                          companies. The combination of known international participants, 
                          interesting exhibition, and local presenters at the 
                          technical sessions, resulted in a reasonable balance 
                          of information flow in both directions.</p>

                        <p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</p>
                        <p>When focusing on Chinese R&amp;D, small through moderate-sized 
                          systems (but not the largest), and on system software, 
                          tools, and some related applications of HPC, the Chinese 
                          are coming up from behind but are very near equality 
                          with the west. Applications, as represented by presentations 
                          at this conference, show a high degree of awareness 
                          of activities in Japan and in the West.</p>
                        <p>Locally developed systems, including the latest Dawning, 
                          resemble clusters, and have other similarities to IBM-SP2. 
                          The latest Dawning 3000 will probably use PowerPCs, 
                          run AIX, and have Myrinet and fast Ethernet, with peak 
                          performance of about 300GFLOPs. A system with 84 nodes 
                          was running at the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the 
                          time of this report. Many system software tools and 
                          some applications have been developed.</p>
                        <p>HPC R&amp;D is centered within a collection of National 
                          High Performance Computing Centers (NHPCC), at universities 
                          in about a dozen major cities. Most projects are guided 
                          by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) 
                          Institute of Computing Technology, and the National 
                          Research Center For Intelligent Computing Systems, also 
                          at the Academy.</p>
                        <p>A 120 processor cluster of Pentiums assembled at CAS 
                          is (just) on the Top500 list, at　44GFLOPs.</p>
                        <p>A number of lead researchers have extensive educational 
                          and training experiences in excellent Western universities, 
                          and are fully conversant with current developments. 
                          There is already substantial expertise in cluster development 
                          (mostly through ICT), as attested to not only by the 
                          technical papers presented at this conference, but also 
                          the locally built systems that are actually in use. 
                          There is enthusiastic interest in cooperating with western 
                          scientists and it is evident that this trend is accelerating, 
                          which should result in substantial science benefits.</p>
                        <p>Government is very supportive of HPC development and 
                          use. An important component concerns plans for training 
                          thousands of new parallel programmers. A national Grid 
                          initiative will connect the national centers and also 
                          has strong government endorsement.</p>
                        <p>Industry use of HPC is very low, due to availability, 
                          skills base, and legacy.</p>
                        <p>The commercial server market in China is strong, although 
                          there is a clear trend toward PC servers and away from 
                          RISCs. These are nominally called Intel Architecture 
                          servers to dilute the negative image wrt reliability 
                          of PCs. Similarly, commercial users view Unix as more 
                          reliable than Windows. HP, IBM, and Compaq cover about 
                          half the PC server market but shares are being threatened 
                          by Chinese brands. The RISC market is led by HP with 
                          Sun improving its position rapidly.</p>
                        <p>Linux popularity is growing rapidly both in the academic 
                          community and also (but to a lesser extent) in commercial 
                          situations. It is now seen as a mature technology, and 
                          a viable alternative to NT or traditional Unix.</p>
                        <p>2. HPC IN CHINA<br>
                          This report benefited from substantial contributions 
                          and comments from Thomas Sterling (Caltech) and Jack 
                          Dongarra (U of Tennessee), who are acknowledged with 
                          gratitude. We have merged many of their remarks, sometimes 
                          edited, into the report body where most appropriate.</p>
                        <p>HPC activities in China combine the development of 
                          indigenous hardware, commercial systems, and network 
                          infrastructure, with the goal of building a National 
                          High Performance Computing Environment (Grid). HPC R&amp;D 
                          is centered within a collection of National High Performance 
                          Computing Centers (NHPCC), including Centers (at universities) 
                          in the cities of Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hefei, 
                          Changsha, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Xi'an. To a large extent 
                          the projects are guided by researchers at the Chinese 
                          Academy of Sciences Institute of Computing Technology, 
                          and the National Research Center For Intelligent Computing 
                          Systems, also at the Academy, with LI, Guojie ?ICT Director 
                          (whose PhD is from Purdue and who also worked at the 
                          Coordinated Science Laboratory of the University of 
                          Illinois), and Prof XU, Zhi Wei (who worked under Kai 
                          Hwang at USC in the Scalable Multiprocessor Research 
                          Group) at NCIC as leaders. Work is largely funded under 
                          the Government's 863 Program.</p>
                        <p>TO get a better sense of china's view of HPC we include, 
                          below, a section of the speech given by Dr Song De MA, 
                          Deputy Minister (Ministry of Science &amp; Technology). 
                          Dr Ma was, until he moved to the Ministry, the President 
                          of Institute of Automation in the Academy of Sciences.</p>
                        <p>&quot;AS we enter the new millennium, China's market 
                          demands for high-performance computing are increasing 
                          rapidly. Last year, sales of medium and large servers 
                          in China grew more than 50%. This increase is a natural 
                          consequence of China's economic growth and social development. 
                          It is a result of increasing applications of high-performance 
                          computing technology in areas such as education, scientific 
                          research, health care, manufacturing, communication, 
                          entertainment, commerce, governmental functions, and 
                          environment protection.</p>
                        <p>&quot;I would like to highlight several large HPC-related 
                          projects that China is undertaking. Last year, we began 
                          a project called &quot;Networking the Governments&quot;, 
                          which connects central and local governments servers 
                          to the Internet, to better serve our citizens. The &quot;Digital 
                          Library&quot; project is planned to put millions of 
                          books on-line, so that the public can access scientific 
                          knowledge, social information, and Chinese culture via 
                          the Web. The &quot;Distance Education&quot; project 
                          aims to provide higher education through the Internet. 
                          This year, we　launched the &quot;ZhongGuanCun High-Tech 
                          Park&quot; project, the &quot;Western China Development&quot; 
                          project, and the &quot;Electronic Commerce&quot; project. 
                          The Chinese government has invested billions of yuan 
                          on these projects, which all need high-performance computers.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Under the leadership of China Ministry of Science 
                          and Technology, Chinese scientists are developing a 
                          &quot;National High-Performance Computing Environment&quot;, 
                          which I believe is called Computational Grid by our 
                          foreign friends. By the end of year 2000, we plan to 
                          build 10 HPC centers all over China. These centers will 
                          be connected by a gigabit per second backbone network. 
                          This environment will enable the Chinese public to share 
                          resources, and to provide services such as oil reservoir 
                          simulation, weather forecasting, scientific research, 
                          bio-informatics studies, digital library, and distant 
                          education.</p>
                        <p>&quot;On behalf of the Ministry of Science and Technology, 
                          I encourage cooperation in the HPC field from our friends 
                          from all over the world, including users, researchers, 
                          educators, and　vendors. Only through mutual understanding 
                          and mutual cooperation, can we build a peaceful and 
                          prosperous world.&quot;</p>
                        <p>From Ma’s remarks and the evidence at HPC-Asia and 
                          in the local research community, it is clear that China 
                          has recognized the value of high performance computing 
                          both for its national and academic application objectives 
                          on the one hand, and as an area of research and development 
                          on the other. Perhaps even more important than the specific 
                          advanced systems they have developed is the long term 
                          tradition of accomplishment and involvement in HPC even 
                          under difficult periods (see Section 3). This continuous 
                          concentration has nurtured a strong and competent community 
                          within the PRC for high performance computing systems 
                          (hardware and software) and applications. This combination 
                          of vision and experience has positioned the HPC China 
                          community to make important contributions and play a 
                          significant role in future development and application 
                          of parallel computing in the 21st Century.</p>
                        <p>3. INSTITUTE OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY (ICT)<br>
                          ICT, inside the Academy of Sciences, has been the center 
                          of Chinese computer R&amp;D. It was the first comprehensive 
                          institute of computing in China, founded in 1956 by 
                          a well known scientist, Prof HUA LuoGeng. Accomplishments 
                          over the years include the following.</p>

                        <p>ICT has been the springboard for a variety of other 
                          Academy institutes, including the　Microelectronics Center, 
                          the Institute of Software, the Network Information Center, 
                          the　Chinese Computer Federation, the National research 
                          Center for Intelligent Computing　Systems (NCIC), and 
                          companies including Legend, Dawning, Hope, and others.</p>
                        <p>Currently, ICT is composed of 6 laboratories that focus 
                          their work in 3 directions.　　　　</p>

                        <p>The research and other projects are performed by 44 
                          professors and nearly 300 graduate　students. Basic information 
                          about ICT is available at the following URL.,　http://www.friends-partners.　org/~china/ins/NCIC/NCIC.html</p>
                        <p>Indigenous equipment, some of which was discussed in 
                          the earlier ATIP report,　“ATIP00.004: HPC in China,” 
                          includes Dawning 2000 (and the new 3000) clustered　systems, 
                          Galaxy 3 (an older MPP system), Sunway 1 (a newer MPP), 
                          and Tsinghua　Tongfang (small cluster). Of these, the 
                          newest and most interesting is the Dawning 3000,　that 
                          can be equipped with up to 160 PowerPC cpus running 
                          AIX, and has peak　performance of about 300GFLOPs (however, 
                          we are told that final details of processor,　OS, etc., 
                          are not settled). One Dawning version we saw has 84 
                          PowerPC nodes running　AIX 4.2.1, all connected with 
                          both Myrinet (for computing) and fast Ethernet (for 
                          cluster　management). A variety of papers in the technical 
                          sessions provide much more detail　about Dawning design 
                          decisions as well as testing and　applications.</p>
                        <p>In the past, developing supercomputers was the domain 
                          of a very few manufacturers in　Japan　and the US. Today’s 
                          microprocessor technology allows high performance systems　to　be　constructed 
                          from large numbers of processors (such as Intel, PowerPC, 
                          and Alpha)　that　can be routinely purchased and then 
                          linked by networks ranging from inexpensive　Ethernet 
                          to　fast Myrinet and other performance communication 
                          fabrics. Operating systems　are　largely　commodity also 
                          and include Linux, AIX, NT, etc. It is true that issues 
                          associated　with very large systems are qualitatively 
                          different from those of small to moderate-size　systems.　Nevertheless, 
                          other than the size of available funding, there is little　distinction　between 
                          systems being built by researchers in the US, China, 
                          or elsewhere. For　example,　Lin-bo　Zhang at the Chinese 
                          Academy has helped to develop a 120 processor cluster 
                          of　Pentiums.　Using LAM MPI 6.4-a3 with benchmark programs 
                          from the University of　Tennessee, Zhang and　his colleagues 
                          get around 40 GFLOPs performance. That would　have　placed 
                          them at position　394 on the November 1999 Top500 list. 
                          The new list just　came out,　and this machine is at number 
                          500 at 44 GFLOP/s.</p>
                        <p>A key component of work at ICT and other Chinese institute 
                          activities is the training of　future scientists and 
                          engineers in HPC concepts and parallel processing. The 
                          report sited　earlier, “ATIP00.004: HPC in China,” discusses 
                          this in more detail. Such a goal is very　forward looking 
                          and is to be highly encouraged. Indeed, it may provide 
                          the role model for other nations including the US. As 
                          Sterling points out, experience with Beowulf has shown　its 
                          importance in providing both the medium and the motivation 
                          for students to learn, often training themselves, in 
                          the management and parallel programming of clusters, 
                          and he　suggests that a Chinese version of his book &quot;How 
                          to Build a Beowulf&quot; could be a good　entry　level 
                          text on implementing and programming clusters such as 
                          the Dawning computer.　There is already substantial expertise 
                          in cluster development (mostly through ICT) in　China, 
                          as　attested to not only by the technical papers presented 
                          at this conference, but　also the locally built systems 
                          that are actually in use.</p>
                        <p>The next step, bringing parallel processing and other 
                          HPC technologies to solve end user　problems is difficult 
                          and requires a concerted effort to attack specific applications. 
                          Only　through end user applications, being applied on 
                          a daily basis to solve essential problems　while supplying 
                          critical services, can parallel high performance computing 
                          be　successful in　China. Here, the ICT and other institutes, 
                          working in conjunction with the　local　computer　science 
                          academic community, supported by the government should 
                          collaborate　with　industry and government agencies to 
                          bring parallel processing to　strategic applications.　This 
                          is already underway and should be greatly and rapidly 
                          expanded.</p>
                        <p>Chinese industry is poised to leverage this national 
                          capability and apply it to the　development of new products 
                          and infrastructure through simulation and alternative 
                          choice　analysis and optimization. Similarly, China-based 
                          expertise offers enormous potential for　China’s national 
                          requirements in government and social infrastructure. 
                          However, thus far,　the migration of this existing capability 
                          to Chinese industry and government is just　beginning. 
                          The issues appear to be availability, skills base, and 
                          legacy. The first　challenge　is being addressed by the 
                          Chinese parallel systems development effort, i.e.,　the　Dawning　systems 
                          and others. The second is being addressed through the 
                          commitment to train a　large number of students to learn 
                          how to parallel program and distributed system　software　and 
                          applications (a goal of training 10,000 new parallel 
                          programmers is　excellent　and　should be pursued aggressively). 
                          The third issue may prove more difficult　and requires　an 
                          energetic and focused initiative to migrate the technology 
                          to the sources　of applications.　Perhaps the initiatives 
                          mentioned by Dr Ma will help to propel this　forward.</p>
                        <p>The Center of High Performance Computing inside ICT 
                          is illustrative of those being　developed at research 
                          facilities in China listed in Section 2 above. CHPC 
                          is funded by　China’s Ministry of Science and Technology 
                          and the Chinese Natural Science Foundation,　and　managed 
                          by ICT. Its main mission is to serve academic researchers 
                          in the Beijing　region.　The Dawning 1000 and Dawning 
                          2000 at ICT are the main servers of the Center.　Its　Director 
                          is Prof. Zhu Mingfa, who is a senior researcher of ICT 
                          (PhD. from Wayne State　University in the 1980s). The 
                          Center's users are mainly from the Chinese Academy of　Sciences 
                          and various universities in Beijing.</p>
                        <p>System and application software does differ significantly 
                          between installations and is an　important area where 
                          added value is provided by manufacturers, and also where 
                          creative　software work can occur in university laboratories. 
                          For example, there is work in NCIC on　PVM and a Myrinet 
                          library for Dawning.</p>
                        <p>3.1 China’s Grid Project</p>
                        <p>The concept of grid computing has generated considerable 
                          interest in China. It is a　natural　way to potentially 
                          utilize resources that are being installed at the HPC 
                          Centers　listed　above　combined with some Gigabit backbone 
                          networks that are also being developed.　The　Chinese 
                          envision several “logical” grids (communities of users 
                          with common　interests),　such as a Biology Grid, Meterology 
                          Grid, Petroleum Grid, Information Grid,　etc., connected　by 
                          grid software to physical grid nodes and the IP Network. 
                          The latter　include the National　Cable TV Backbone (1Gbps 
                          channel for intra-Grid connection), CERNET　(China’s　Research 
                          &amp; Educational Network, currently at 155 Mbps and 
                          scheduled to be　upgraded to　622Mbps and　shortly thereafter 
                          to 2.5Gpbs, and other high bandwidth networks　when　available 
                          such as the NSFCnet in the Beijing area. The Grid System 
                          Software provides　services to users, including Security, 
                          User Management, Resource Directories, Batch Job　Management, 
                          Online Help, etc. There is a common interface layer, 
                          which connects to the　individual hardware interfaces 
                          (Sun Way 1, Galaxy 3, Longfang 108, Dawning) at the　distributed 
                          Centers.</p>
                        <p>Computational applications that are specifically planed 
                          include the following.<br>
                          　　Petroleum exploration, associated with the Da Qing 
                          oil field<br>
                          　　Weather forecasting, associated with NMA<br>
                          　　Industrial design, in cooperation with Shanghai Shipping 
                          Corp<br>
                          　　Numerical Wind Tunnel<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>More general and scientific information applications 
                          include<br>
                          　　　Bioinformatics (China has more than 100,000 bio-science　researchers)<br>
                          　　　Digital library in cooperation with the Ministry 
                          of Culture<br>
                          　　　National Science Database (there are terabytes of 
                          relevant scientific data)</p>
                        <p>There is still a wide gap between Chinese capabilities 
                          in these areas and that in the　West.　High end computing, 
                          especially PC clusters such as Beowulf and the use of 
                          the　Internet,　Web, and Grid, are having an explosive 
                          growth and evolution throughout the US and　Europe as 
                          well as some other parts of Asia, such as Japan, Australia, 
                          and Singapore.　China’s Grid project is a good start 
                          but it will be important for Chinese scientists to　embrace, 
                          track, and participate in this revolution, with adequate 
                          support from their　government. Applications relevant 
                          to the future of China are the ones that are appropriate　to 
                          drive this engagement. But, equally important is the 
                          necessity to supply distributed　hardware systems and 
                          parallel system software to support the needs of China’s 
                          HPC　developers and users. Additionally, China needs 
                          to encourage and bring visitors from the　international 
                          community to meet with and talk to the Chinese computer 
                          science community,　giving seminars to convey and explain 
                          the visions of future high performance computer　systems 
                          and environments. Also, they should continue to support 
                          their own students and　scientists at foreign universities, 
                          as human technology transfer is an important resource.　This 
                          last has already been successful and should be enhanced.</p>
                        <p>Tom Sterling comments that the challenge of making 
                          parallel HPC capabilities available　can　be addressed 
                          by extending the knowledge and experience gained with 
                          Dawning but　ported　to a class of system that is more 
                          easily duplicated and distributed. His　experience　with 
                          Beowulf-class PC clusters suggests that the exploitation 
                          and system　integration of　mass market computing components 
                          by means of commercial local area and　system area　networks 
                          is very effective. An important property of Beowulf-class 
                          systems　forChina is that　they are similar to Dawning, 
                          allowing the experience, tools, and　methodology developed 
                          by　the Chinese HPC community to be readily conveyed 
                          (ported) to　Beowulfs. China is capable　of establishing 
                          organizations (institutes, industry companies,　etc.) 
                          that can provide system　integration of the hardware 
                          and software of Chinese Beowulf’　. Because the software 
                          and　hardware can be acquired from many sources across 
                          the　international community, this　approach will be safer 
                          for China, as vulnerability to　external decisions is 
                          low. These　systems are easily duplicated and are very 
                          low cost. They　can be placed easily at　universities 
                          for research and education and in industry and　government 
                          labs to meet　commerce and national needs. This probably 
                          will require the　employment of open source　Linux, which 
                          has already begun. Companies such as Turbo-Linux,　who 
                          already have a　presence in China, can be very helpful.</p>
                        <p>4. PRESENTATIONS</p>
                        <p>As noted earlier, invited presentations were by HPC 
                          leaders, mostly from the West. While<br>
                          interesting, we omit summarizing those here to conserve 
                          space.</p>
                        <p>Although there were many Japanese participants at the 
                          research level, only one Japanese　vendor was present, 
                          Hitachi, and Yoshio Aihara gave a good summary (“Hardware　Technology　and 
                          Architecture Aspects for a Tera-scale Infrastructure 
                          Age”) of his　company’s current machine (the 128 node 
                          machine -- installed at the University of Tokyo,　has 
                          1 TFLOP capability) and future strategy (a 512 node 
                          system, i.e., 4TFLOP will be　available this year). This 
                          presentation is available as a PowerPoint file that 
                          also includes　examples of special characteristics of 
                          Hitachi’s SR8000, which includes (a) “pseudo-vector-processor” 
                          (PVP) to simulate vector processing using RISC processors 
                          with　reasonable development costs and times, and (b) 
                          COMPAS (Cooperative Multi-Processors　in single Address 
                          Space) for Intra-node parallel processing. Several very 
                          interesting　benchmarks are included such as a large 
                          3D FFT. (An independent technical paper at the　conference 
                          discusses FFT performance on the SR8000 using another 
                          model, c.f.,Takahashi.) Concerning future directions, 
                          Aihara notes that to get to performance nearing　100TFLOPs, 
                          the approach should be to combine enhanced node performance 
                          with　increasing numbers of nodes. At the same time, 
                          memory performance becomes more　important with increasing 
                          bandwidth (number of interleaves) required. Possible　solutions　include 
                          SDRAM burst reads, larger cache sizes, and algorithms 
                          using sequential　MS　accesses. Internode network requirements 
                          also increase, and Aihara feels the correct　solution 
                          here is via optical fibers. In the reviewed technical 
                          papers, we note the paper　by　Takahashi above, and another, 
                          very well written, by Naono et al (Hitachi) on high　performance 
                          tridiagonalization for the SR8000. A paper on block 
                          size selection for　parallel　LU factorization on Hitachi’s 
                          SR2201 was presented by Yungquan Zhang at the CAS Inst　of 
                          Software. Also, Chi Xuebin et al (Inst of Software, 
                          CAS) presented some　benchmarks for　BLAS, LAPACK &amp; 
                          ScaLAPACK, also on the SR8000.</p>
                        <p>Although Aihara’s presentation focused on an evolutionary 
                          strategy built on the SR8000　technology, ATIP suspects 
                          that the company is also concerned about the small size 
                          of the　multi-TFLOP HPC market and the degree to which 
                          cost effective efforts ought to be　leveraging commodities.</p>
                        <p>Although a few papers have been mentioned above, with 
                          nearly 400 presentations,　primarily　from local Chinese, 
                          it isn’t reasonable to summarize these here. As might 
                          be　expected in　an environment where HPC assets are still 
                          not widely diffused, many papers　remain highly　academic, 
                          lacking motivation, and experimental support. There 
                          are some　notable exceptions, and especially in the workshops 
                          (see below). As international　participants remarked 
                          and readers of the proceedings will discover, Chinese 
                          scientists are　tackling many of the same problems that 
                          are being addressed in the West. This is　particularly 
                          true at the well known universities and CAS, but this 
                          also occurs at much less　known sites. We also are happy 
                          to note that with only a few exceptions the English　expositions 
                          are more than adequate, a　situation that has improved 
                          significantly in recent　years. On average, papers from 
                          more developed Asian countries, including Taiwian,　Korea, 
                          and Japan addressed more current topics, including mobile 
                          communication,　networks, and distributed systems. However　architectural 
                          topics, some numerical　applications, clustering, and 
                          others are being studied everywhere. Here, we note a 
                          few　papers that we found technically interesting.</p>

                        <p>The session on Java was particularly interesting, mostly 
                          because of numerical applications　that were described 
                          including a prototype PIC (Particle in Cell) code and 
                          a more general　Ninf CFD component for global (grid)

                        <p>In the Clustering workshop papers were longer and had 
                          more detail. Here we only mention　a paper from the National 
                          Center for High Performance Computing in Taiwan, comparing　some　application 
                          codes, both their own, and the NAS Parallel Benchmarks,

                        <p>5. CHINA’S COMMERCIAL SERVER MARKET</p>
                        <p>Outside the pure research community, the primary market 
                          for HPC products are for　servers.　In China this refers 
                          to RISC and PC servers, with the latter now renamed 
                          (in　China) as IA　Servers (Intel Architecture) (PC’s 
                          have a mildly negative image in the Chinese　business　community, 
                          and tend to be associated with low-end applications, 
                          compared to　RISC or other　Unix systems which are viewed 
                          as more reliable and having better I/O and　processing　capability).</p>
                        <p>5.1 IA ServersMarket growth is smooth, with more than 
                          129,000 units sold (19% more than　1998) and with revenue 
                          increased by 17% to RMB3.9B. Table 1 shows market changes　since　1997.　　　　　　　　　</p>

                          1999 　　　　129,000　　　　　19.4　　　　　3.93　　　　　　　17.31</p>
                        <p>Of this total, about 1/3 are for workgroup use, nearly 
                          half for department level use, and　the　remainder (about 
                          20%) for enterprise (corporate) use. The distinction 
                          between PC and　Unix (RISC) servers is gradually decreasing 
                          as a result of improvements in CPU and bus　technology 
                          as well as the infusion of NT (Unix-like) systems. PC 
                          (or IA) servers are also　seen as having improved in 
                          their capability of operating in a multiprocessor capacity 
                          (small　to medium symmetric multiprocessor). PC clusters 
                          have also begun to appear in　commercial applications, 
                          increasing system reliability when individual units 
                          are used to　back each other up in case of failure. Chinese 
                          users are also impressed with efforts by　Intel to improve 
                          performance, for example new I/O capabilities (I^2O), 
                          and bus speed　improvements up to 300MHz. In short, IT 
                          professionals here see IA servers having a major　impact 
                          on the traditional RISC server world. They are certainly 
                          dominant in low-end　applications, and are rapidly moving 
                          into the medium and higher level Chinese market.　However 
                          small and mid-level systems are still the primary market, 
                          and especially so for　network applications. The　potential 
                          unsatisfied Chinese market remains very large. At the　same 
                          time commercial users are particularly cognizant of 
                          the need to access larger　databases and service more 
                          network queries reliably, and thus system features that　address　these 
                          issues will become　increasingly important. Department 
                          level servers (dual　CPU, 30-50,000RMB) are becoming　increasingly 
                          in demand and low-end single CPU　servers will　probably 
                          fall out of favor. With Intel processors dominating 
                          the market, server　manufacturers are forced to provide 
                          other distinguishing features or service, in　particular　competing 
                          on total cost of ownership. In this market, HP, IBM, 
                          and Compaq are　the major　vendors, taking 56.9% of the 
                          total market. However, as the presence of local　companies　increases, 
                          the market share trend for these three is down, with 
                          combined　share in 1997　and 1998 of 64.3% and 58.1% respectively.

                        <p>In 1999, China IA server consumers were concentrated 
                          in the telecom, finance,　government, business/enterprise, 
                          education, communication, military and insurance　industries.

                          with sales in North, East, and South　China accounting 
                          for 25, 23, and 19% respectively, and sectors such as 
                          the Northwest or　Northeast having about 7% each (Beijing 
                          is in the North). These percentages have not　changed

                          plans to introduce its IA64 chip and　aggravated by suspicion 
                          about the future of RISC technology. The situation improved 
                          in　1999, due to Chinese views of the following.</p>

                        <p>Based on sales volumes, HP is the leader at the high-end, 
                          with Sun improving rapidly,　eventually surpassing IBM. 
                          Sun’s prices are thought to be 35-40% lower than either 
                          IBM’s　or HP’s and that company has taken over the workstation 
                          and is doing well in the low-end　server market.</p>

                        <p>5.3 General Comparisons</p>
                        <p>Both RISC servers and IA servers have their own markets 
                          and this will continue for a long　time in China. The 
                          server market will grow rapidly this year, 2000. There 
                          will be real　growth　both at the high and low end, but 
                          low-end RISC Servers will be replaced by IA　Servers 
                          or　lower-cost and higher performance Unix workstations. 
                          A competitive　relationship　is　developing between traditional 
                          Unix and NT with each evolving their own　user base. 
                          Linux　popularity is growing rapidly; it is now seen 
                          as a mature technology, and　a viable　alternative to 
                          NT or traditional Unix. With price changes and some 
                          increase in Chinese　products the server market has become 
                          more competitive.</p>
                        <p>6. CONCLUSION<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>When focusing on Chinese R&amp;D, if we narrow our 
                          attention to small through moderate-sized　systems (but 
                          not the largest), and on system software, tools, and 
                          some related　applications　of HPC, the Chinese are coming 
                          up from behind but are very near equality　with　the west. 
                          The challenge to them is to stay in synchrony with the 
                          rapid change of the　rest of the world and to contribute 
                          to it while applying it to the needs of China. Their　Dawning 
                          system especially, provides an important base of experience 
                          in parallel　computing　hardware and software. To have 
                          the maximum impact this experience needs to　be transferred　to 
                          a widely distributable form (such as Beowulf-class PC 
                          clusters) in order to　stimulate a　large number of installations 
                          of such systems to provide high availability and　accessibility.</p>
                        <p>Concerning HPC-Asia2000 itself, holding this in Beijing 
                          was a very important event for　China. Success in high 
                          performance computing and the effective exploitation 
                          of parallel　processing will depend on China being engaged 
                          as a member of the international　community,　leveraging 
                          much of the relevant work done throughout this global 
                          community,and contributing　to it with China's own software 
                          products where appropriate. The HPC-Asia　conference 
                          went a long way to establish China as part of that community. 
                          It was clear to　all　the Western　visitors, that China 
                          has a number of very capable, intelligent,　knowledgeable,　and　experienced 
                          experts in their academic and institutional research　community.</p>
                        <p>Interactions were extremely cordial, even friendly, 
                          with a sincere willingness to engage in　cooperation. 
                          Tom Sterling states this directly; “I found that the 
                          cultural differences　between　us and our Chinese colleagues 
                          that I had thought would impose barriers　precluding 
                          such　exchanges, may very well not be a problem. Visiting 
                          China allowed　me to view first hand　an energetic, friendly, 
                          and interested people engaged in a　rapidly growing economy 
                          and　evolving society. I came away with the impression 
                          of real and substantial opportunity.”</p>

                        <p>The HPC-Asia Steering Committee received several proposals 
                          for the next conference　venue　and ultimately decided 
                          that HPC-Asia2001 will be organized by the Australian　Partnership　for 
                          Advanced Computing (APAC) and sited in Queensland Australia, 
                          23-26　September 2001. For　further information, please

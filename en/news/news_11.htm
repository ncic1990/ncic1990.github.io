                  <p>　　Dawning 4000L, the largest data processing super-server
                    in China, is coming out recently. This machine, which has
                    been ranked as the “aircraft carrier” in China’s super-server
                    industry, not only provides hundreds terabytes data processing
                    capability, but also overcomes many key issues to support
                    data intensive applications. Dawning 4000L is developed by
                    National Research Center for Intelligent Computing Systems
                    (NCIC) and Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd. NCIC is
                    a division of Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese
                    Academy of Sciences (CAS). Dawning 4000L Super-server is
                    suitable for both high performance scientific computing applications
                    and information services. It is a milestone for China’s high
                    performance super-server industry, which is changing its
                    focus from scientific computing to information services.
                    Dawning 4000L breaks the China’s super-server record again
                    and leads the super-server industry to a new era.                  </p>
                  <p>　　Dawning 4000L is the largest IDC data processing machine
                    in China now. It has been designed to provide more than 3
                    teraflops computing capability with 644 processors, 644GB
                    physical memory and 100 terabytes storage. The machine can
                    be upgraded online to 6.75 teraflops computing capability
                    with 1300 processors, 4000GB physical memory and 600 terabytes
                    storage. The whole system will consist with 80 racks and
                    need 160KW power supply.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>　　Dawning 4000L is an innovation and progress of traditional
                    cluster technology in the new era. It is focused on data
                    intensive applications. Spreader, an intelligent file browser,
                    supports fast file search and browse over 100 terabytes storage,
                    so that finding useful information become much easier. Intelligent
                    NIC with its special software makes it easier to exchange
                    real-time data with Internet. TapeShare, a system uses tapes
                    to backup data, further improves the capacity of sharing
                    devices for massive data storing. Dawning 4000L has two grid
                    enabling techniques. Intelligent control terminal can manage
                    the huge system in security. GridView provides grid visual
                    angle of the system. Dawning 4000L has flexible on-line scalability.
                    It provides 7 kinds of monitoring mechanisms to guarantee
                    system reliability.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>　　Dawning 4000L provides a high capability in massive data
                    processing. It can process more than 16.3 billion insert
                    operations and 8.6 billion mixed operations with the parallel
                    database every day. The average response time of data mining
                    in millions records is 2.5 seconds. It has real time processing
                    capability to deal with the information generated by 40 million
                    persons 200 SMS each per day. It has real time processing
                    capability to deal with more than 650,000 Internet packets
                    per second each node and has a total capability of 32Gbps
                    data connection volume. The 400Mbps data per-character processing
                    capability on each node can satisfy the requirement of China
                    Telecom’s Internet backbone. Dawning 4000L has such a powerful
                    data processing capability and has been ranked as the “aircraft
                    carrier” in China super-server industry.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>　　Dawning4000L is co-developed by National Research Center
                    of Intelligent Computing Systems (NCIC) and Dawning Information
                    Industry Co., Ltd. The latter has adequate experiences in
                    building large-scale commercial computing systems. Its product

                  <p>1. Oil Exploration<br>
                    　　Earthquake exploration is an important approach to determine
                      the geological structure of an area and play an important
                      role in prospect for oil. One key technique is how to locate
                      the artesian well. A wrong position will lead to great
                      loss as well as missing the mission. Generally, Prospect
                      for 100 kilo-meter square area would produce data as many
                      as 30GB-60GB and Supercomputer of 1 TFlops needs two month
                      to process these data. So, development of high performance
                      computer hardware and parallel software for oil prove is
                      of great significance.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Satellite Image Processing<br>
                    <br>
                    　　Remote sensing technique with satellite has been widely
                    used in agriculture, geology, hydrology, archeology and global
                    environment exploration. It can produce massive image data.
                    It usually need process these data as fast as possible. Study
                    and development of parallel processing approach and useful
                    technique, especially advanced system architecture and friendly
                    user interface will play a key role in economics and national
                    defense.</p>
                  <p>3. Environmental Protection and Meteorology<br>
                    <br>
                    　　The equation for weather forecast had been established
                    at the beginning of 1920’s. But only after the emergence
                    of computer can digital weather forecast is possible. Weather
                    forecast was limited to 24 hours by the capacity of processing
                    before parallel computer system is available. High performance
                    computing is an essential approach to solving the massive
                    scientific computing in digital weather forecast. Weather
                    forecast can be more precise with the high performance computing
                    technique to improve the differentiate ratio. In recent years,
                    Weather Bureau of Beijing makes great progress in guarantee
                    service of some extreme weather events such as high temperature
                    in middle of summer and time of sand storm in spring using
                    middle-scale forecast of 5-15 kilometer with the revise of
                    forecaster.</p>
                  <p>4. Auto Manufacture<br>
                    <br>
                    　　High performance computing is the basis of wide use of
                    information. Three approaches can be used in full range of
                    information for enterprise. The first is adding electronic
                    element to product to enhance function and to improve quality.
                    The second emphasizes on management with the content of information
                    management, resource management and flow control, such as
                    ERP and MIS. The third emphasizes on techniques and products
                    with CAD/CAE/CAM. Manufacture industry emphasizes on the
                    product. Study of digital emulation and simulator with high
                    performance computer is helpful to develop higher performance
                    autos in short time as well as virtual car collision experiment,
                    humanity car design, improving safety and reliability, environment
                    protection and comfort, promotion of entire design grade
                    of the auto industry, shortening design cycle, deducing design
                  cost.</p>
                  <p>5. Aeronautic and Aerospace</p>
                  <p>                    　　In aeronautic and aerospace industries,
                    high performance computing is mainly applied to aspects of
                    scientific computing, real-time emulation, image processing,
                    artificial intelligence, database and CAD etc. In current
                    aircraft design flow, high performance computing, wind tunnel
                    experiment and free-flight motion are the three ways to obtain
                    aircraft aerodynamic force data. Adopting the methods of
                    computational fluid dynamics and computational aerodynamics
                    can shorten period, reduce cost, change parameters and repeat
                    computing. For the future aircrafts with which experiment
                    cannot be carried out in specific flying mode, numerical
                    simulation method can reduce risk of designing and can make
                    decision rapidly for hopeful design proposal before the wind
                    tunnel experiment. Some countries that have advanced technologies,
                    such as USA, always equip the best parallel computer in national
                  aeronautics and space administration.</p>
                  <p>6. Defense Industries<br>
                    <br>
                    　　In Many aspects of defense industry studies, such as armor
                    protection performance research, shrapnel throwing simulation,
                    shell drill-through simulation, filling ammunition security
                    evaluation, anti-damage of defense work etc, all largely
                    uses the methods of computing simulation and numerical simulation.
                    These studies sometimes cannot obtain overall result through
                    experiment, but can obtain them through virtual “experiments”
                    by using numerical simulation technology on computer system.
                    Furthermore, these “experiments” can take account of various
                    possible states including ultimate state. At present time,
                    numerical simulation technology has played an important role
                    in the development of martial facility.</p>
                  <p>7. Antagonizes among Systems<br>
                    <br>
                    　　High performance computing technology has the same important
                    effect in high-tech warfare, such as making the battle plans,
                    handling intelligence and information, commanding and deploying
                    troops, coordinating the actions in a battle etc. In Gulf
                    War, a group of mainframe computers were installed in American
                    headquarters at the Gulf, which established the strong C3I
                    system. The various information of military intelligence,
                    progress of the battle, objects to attack and organize soldiers
                    etc, was synchronously shown on the screen of main console.
                    The huge supplies of logistics were under the control of
                    two mainframe computers.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    8.  Hydraulics and Hydropower<br>
                    <br>
                    　　The problems of Main dam designing, building technology,
                    security and prolonging life are all major problems that
                    are desiderated to resolve in department of water resources
                    and hydropower. The calculation scale of them mainly depends
                    on calculation field that is usually huge. High performance
                    computer system is the indispensable tool to resolve this
                    type of problems.</p>
                  <p>9. The Ships' Design<br>
                    <br>
                    　　Ships design includes: Ship overall design and optimization,
                    the simulation research of the ship’s load environment, the
                    ship’s construction designs and strength designs etc. The
                    huge ship researches usually take the method of designing
                    one ship and manufacture it, it is impossible to do the 1:1
                    experiment, therefore, the simulation technology like finite
                    element and finite difference etc. play a dispensable role
                    in the aspects of ship’s design and analysis.<br>
                    <br>
                    10. Buildings and Bridges<br>
                    <br>
                    　　The city modernization progress is updated everyday. The
                    skyscrapers and edifices, bridges and tunnels are changing
                    our cities greatly. The safety of the buildings/bridges/tunnels,
                    including the capabilities of anti-earthquake, anti-destruction;
                    anti-fire etc. becomes the urgent issues that need to be
                    solved. The nation promulgates a flood of laws and regulations,
                    which states that only based on large quantities of analyzing
                    and calculating, can this kind of questions be answered.
                    This is also an important application field of high performance
                    computation.</p>
                  <p>11. Medicine Design<br>
                    <br>
                    　　With the fast development of the computer technology, the
                    design and discovery of the medicine are also changed from
                    dependence on &quot;luck&quot; and large quantity of random
                    synthesis in design and discovering new medicine to exploit
                    of new medicine purposely and rationally with the usage of
                    computers. The CADD’s main purpose is to make use of statistics
                    and molecular model to guide the new leading structural designs
                    or detections, and reduce the waste on time and resources
                    before the new medicine is put into the market.</p>
                  <p>12. Bioinformatics<br>
                    <br>
                    　　The bioinformatics takes the analysis of DNA sequence
                    information as the research origin, works out the secrete
                    concealing in the DNA sequence heredity language, finds out
                    the coding region that represents protein and RNA gene, especially
                    clarified substantial content of non-coding-region; predicts
                    and simulates the protein’s space construction after the
                    discovering of new gene information; and then proceed the
                    necessary medicine design according to particular protein
                    function. Hence, in the era of genome study, the bio-informatics
                    includes three important parts: genome informatics, the simulation
                    on proteomics and the medicine designs. Either for computer
                    science theories, fast arithmetic design and analysis, or
                    for the development toward high performance computer, the
                    bio-informatics makes a lot of challenging problems.</p>
                  <p>13. Computational Chemistry<br>
                    <br>
                    　　Computing technology has changed traditional chemistry
                    greatly. The chemistry has transferred the method from only-experiment-no-calculation
                    to experiment-before-calculation; also surely will transfer
                    to computation-before-experiment gradually. Without studies
                    on computer-aided construction analyzing, molecular design
                    and the synthesis route design with the usage of high-performance
                    computer, it is impossible to proceed the vast chemistry
                    knowledge effectively, to systematically search the changes
                    of properties by the structure variation, and to logically
                    proceed certain reasoning, to identify the correct molecular
                    construction, to predict the compound molecular construction
                    with certain property, and to analyze the synthesis route
                    etc.</p>
                  <p>14. Computational Geography</p>
                  <p>　　Urban geographical calculation is a typical data-intensive
                    application that only with the facility of high performance
                    computer can we develop the work to solve the geographical
                    problems characterized with &quot;integral&quot;, &quot;huge-volume&quot; data,
                    to answer some important problems in city construction, such
                    as the problem of the commuter movement forecast between
                    the center and the skirt of a city; census, population forecast,
                    population layout over districts; the problems of the reconstruction
                    of the type, construction, function, organization of families,
                    communities as the basic living unit of a city; the simulation
                    of urban industry, economy development principles, mechanism,
                    pervasion, etc.; the morphological evolution of a city in
                  different time-, space- scales, etc.</p>
                  <p>15. Computational Physics</p>
                  <p>　　This study deals with the numerical calculation of the
                    physical problems in the fields of statistical physics, quantum
                    mechanics, fluid dynamics, nuclear particle movement, nuclear
                    physics, astrophysics, solid physics, plasma physics, dispersion
                    of atoms and molecule, the earth's surface wave, geophysics,
                    radio astronomy, controlled thermonuclear reaction and atmospheric
                    circumfluence. Physics is the most popular field that uses
                  high performance computing among fundamental sciences.</p>

                    in all kinds of science such as natural science, social science,
                    etc. With the increasing volume, complexity and precision
                    in systems of human society, the importance of probability
                    and statistics will become larger and larger. For example,
                    the popular application of stochastic analysis, time-sequence
                    analysis, multi-variate statistic analysis, regression analysis,
                    statistic computing, sampling survey, assurance statistics,

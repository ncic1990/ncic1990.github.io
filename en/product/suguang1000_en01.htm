<A NAME="over" class="titlenglish">1. Overview</A>
<p>

	The Dawning-1000 Massively Parallel Processing System, which is the
most important key project of the 863 Program, has been successfully developed
by the National Research Center for Intelligent Computing Systems (NCIC) in
April, 1995. Its success indicates that the technologies of the massively
parallel processing (MPP) of China have come up to the advanced world levles,
and its success is considered as a milestone of the high performance computer
community of China.<p>

	The Dawning-1000 broke through some key technologies in the MPP, and
exploits a lot of advanced technologies of 1990s. Its peak speed achieves 2.5
GFLOPS (billion floating point instructions per second), and its practical
computing speed is 1.58 GFLOPS. It has up to 1024 Mbytes of memory. The
Dawning-1000 represents the most advanced high-performance computer in China.
It is a efficient, stable and reliable system which is easy to use. Its
technical features includes:<p>

<ul>
<li>
	Good extensibility, include scalable connection network, expandable
computing power and I/O power. Both its hardware and software are scalable. It
can scale up to a MPP system containing hundries or even thousands of computing
nodes. It obviously excels the SMP systems and the tranditional vector machines
in this point.

<li>
	Large number of nodes, high computing power, large volume of memory.
It can handle the problems which are hard to deal with by workstations or
traditional supercompter. For examples, a weather forecast program, which
forecasts the coming 48 hours weather condition of the whole area of China,
needs only 3 hours to run on the Dawning-1000, but runs over 60 hours on
ordinary computers such as workstations (the results are of no use then). A
3-dimention iterative deviation kernel program for seismic data processing in
the petroleum prospecting field runs only 11 minutes on the Dawning-1000,
but runs over 10 hours on workstations without results. Compares with vector
supercomputers, the Dawning-1000 has higher performance/cost ratio.

<li>
	The self-designed, stable and reliable wormhole communication chip,
which extensively exploits the combination of asynchrous mode and synchrous
mode, with higher message passing speed.

<li>
	The message passing protocol with flow control, which provided high 
efficiency and high reliability for system communications.

<li>
	High quality of the optimizing compiler, which provided efficient
and practical parallel compile and comes up to the advanced world level.

<li>
	the advanced parallel programming environment, parallel debugging
tools, automatic parallelizing tools and the realtime visualization tool of
parallel programs, including PVM, EXPRESS, NX Interface, Autopar, NDB, and
Paravision, etc., make the use of the MPP system much easier.

<li>
	Standard and high quality of the system design and the hardware
production, high quality of the system software, high reliability of the whole
system.

<li>
	Extensively exploiting the international standards, the highly open
system, which makes it much easier for the users to port the environments,
tools, and large application softwares.
</ul>

	The Dawning-1000 comes up to advanced world level of the early 1990s.<p>

	The Dawning-1000 can be widely used in many fields such as seismic
data processing in the petroleum prospecting field, weather forecast,
scientific research, teaching and education, business processing, banking,
stock broking, and so on, it can bring about tremendous economic and social
benefits. Especially, It is the ideal choice for the computer system of
supercomputing centers.<p><p>

</ul>

                  <A NAME="hard" class="titlenglish">3. Hardware of the Dawning-1000</A> <br>
                  <A NAME="arch" class="titlen01">3.1 System Architecture</A> 
                  <br>
                  The Dawning-1000 is a loosely-coupled message passing massively 
                  parallel processing system. It is made up of 32 computing nodes 
                  (each of which is based on the i860 microprocessor), the system 
                  service subsystem which contains one or two nodes, and the external 
                  storage subsystem which contains two or three I/O nodes. All 
                  these nodes are connected by a 6x6 2-dimention mesh. Each point 
                  on the mesh has a wormhole router. There is a system monitor 
                  which charges the system initialization and the hardware failure 
                  diagnosis. The working platforms for the users are SUN Sparc-II 
                  workstations (or other workstations, eg. SGI) and some terminals. 
                  The system servic nodes, monitor, the Sparc-II workstations 
                  and the terminals are connected by a 10 Mb/s Ethernet. Fig 1 
                  shows the Dawning-1000 system architecture. 
                  <p>

                  <A NAME="mesh" class="titlen01">3.2 Mesh Network</A> <br>
                  The mesh network in Fig 1 is extensible. Each node (including 
                  system service node and I/O node) is connected with a wormhole 
                  routing chip (WRC). The numbering of the nodes (the physical 
                  addresses of the nodes) is made up of two parts: the numbering 
                  in X direction and the numbering in Y direction. The relative 
                  address between two nodes is contained in messages. A WRC has 
                  10 input/output channels. Each channel contains 8 datalines, 
                  a Tail signal which indicates the end of a message, a sending 
                  request line (REQ) and an acknowledging line (ACK). When a message 
                  is sent from a source node to a destination node, it only passes 
                  through the WRCs on the way, and doesn't go into the node processors 
                  connected by the WRCs. The mesh used X-Y routing algorithm. 
                  Several channels can share a unidirectional physical channel. 
                  <p> <A NAME="comput" class="titlen01">3.3 Computing Nodes</A> 
                    <br>
                    A computing node is a plug-in board, the kernel of which is 
                    a i860xr chip, the frequency of the chip is 40 MHZ, the word 
                    length is 64 bits, the floating point computing speed is 80 
                    MFLOPS for single precision and 60 MFLOPS for double precision, 
                    the scalar computing speed is 40 MIPS. It has 32 MB DRAM with 
                    parity check, 8 KB EPROM, and 2 KB NVRAM which is powered 
                    by batteries. The node-mesh interface module contains two 
                    16 KB FIFOs. The communication bandwidth between the mesh 
                    and each node is 33 MB/s, with CRC check of message data. 
                    The RS232 module on each node board is directly connected 
                    to a multi-user card on the monitor in order that the monitor 
                    can supervise and disgnose the node processor. All computing 
                    nodes run operating system and user programs.
                  <p> <A NAME="service" class="titlen01">3.4 System Service Nodes</A> 
                    <br>
                    The system service nodes are provided for managing the system 
                    resources (especially the node processors). A service node 
                    is a 50 MHZ 486 PC with a EISA bus. There is a EISA-Mesh interface 
                    module (EMI) between the EISA bus and the mesh network. There 
                    is DMA mechanism on the EMI card, which is a EISA plug-in 
                    card. The data path FIFO-Mesh-FIFO has CRC check. The communication 
                    speed between the EMI card and the mesh is 16 MB/s. When there 
                    are a lot of users and a lot of graphic displaying, two service 
                    nodes can be provided, and they can work coordinately by shareing 
                    a system resource table.
                  <p>

<A NAME="i/o" class="titlen01">3.5 I/O nodes</A><br>

	An I/O node is a 486 PC with a EISA bus, as the same as the service
nodes, and has a EMI plug-in card. An I/O node can be connected to a 4 GB
harddisk by a SCSI card pluged on the EISA bus. The system can have one or two
I/O nodes. User who require large I/O throughputs can have more I/O nodes, but
the number of computing nodes must be reduced correspondingly. The data
transfering speed between an I/O node and the mesh network is 16 MB/s. Each I/O
node runs a parallel file system, and performs parallel file operations.
                  <p> <A NAME="console" class="titlen01">3.6 System Console</A> 
                    <br>
                    There is a system console for the whole system, which runs 
                    UNIX. The console has a multi-user card, which is connected 
                    to the RS232 serial ports of the 32 computing node boards. 
                    The console can perform point-to-point communication with 
                    any computing node, and also can broadcast messages to all 
                    computing nodes simultaneously. Its main fuctions are initializing 
                    the system, supervising the running of the operating system 
                    and user programs on the computing nodes, dinamically looking 
                    up the node processor resource configuration table and diagnosing 
                    the hardware failures of the computing nodes.

<A NAME="network" class="titlen01">3.7 Network of the Front-End Computers</A><br>

	The working platforms for users of Dawning-1000 are one or more SUN
Sparc-II colored graphical workstations (or SGI graphical workstations), and 
some terminals. All these devices are connected to the system service nodes by
a LAN (Ethernet or WAN). The LAN obeys TCP/IP protocol, and its data
transfering speed is 10 Mb/s. In fact, the mesh system can be considered as a
computing server for the front-end network system. User programs are edited,
compiled, linked and debugged on the front-end computers, and then are sent to
the compuing nodes by the service nodes, and the computing results are
displayed by the front-end computers.

                    <A NAME="operat" class="titlen01">4.1 Operating System</A> 
                    <br>
                    The operating system of the Dawning-1000 is based on UNIX. 
                    The operating system on the computing nodes is a micro kernel 
                    operating system, supporting virtual memory management, trap 
                    processing, job management and message passing. The file serving 
                    is a client running on the user space.
                  <p>

	The operating system on the service nodes is based on Mach2.6,
supporting multithread. Its main function is system management, especially the
node processor allocation and deallocation. The I/O nodes run the parallel
file server PFS. The service nodes and the I/O nodes have the same message
passing interface with the computing nodes. The system implements message
passing protocol with flow control, which is efficient and reliable.<p>

<A NAME="para" class="titlen01">4.2 Parallel Optimizing Compiler and Tools</A><br>

	The compile optimization for the node programs includes source code
level optimization and object code level optimization. The former exploits the
methods such as loops exchange, loops merging and loops strip dividing. The
latter is fully utilize the pipeline, the double-instruction mode and the
double-operation instructions provided by the i860, and the floating point
load instructions to vectorize the loops.<p>

	The Autopar is a self-developed automatic parallelizing tool, which can
recognize parallel loops, perform data partition, and produce parallel FORTRAN
source codes with loop level parallel.<p>

	Paravision, the visualization tool of parallel programs is developed
for the Dawning-1000, and is also portable on other MPP systems. Users can use
it to watch the dynamic running of programs, including message passing
conditions, load balancing conditions and whether or not deadlock occuring, 
etc.<p>

<A NAME="program" class="titlen01">4.3 Parallel Programming Environment and Parallel Debugging Tools</A><br>

	We have ported three well-known interface or environment ---- NX
Interface, EXPRESS and PVM on the Dawning-1000, in order to facilitate users
programming and running parallel programs. The NX is a parallel user
programming interface on the Paragon system. The EXPRESS and PVM are two
extensively used parallel programming and running environment in the world.<p>

	The parallel program debugger includes the source code level debugger
NDB and the assembly code level debugger ADB. Their chief functions are 
display, setting and clearing instruction (or data) breakpoints, memory
read/write, running programs step by step or continuously, or sending and
receiving the states of current process. They can debug programs running on
multiple nodes.<p>

<UL>
<LI><a name="world" class="titlen01">The Dawning-1000 came up to the advanced world levels of the early
1990s.</a><p></UL>

<ol>
<li>
    The self-developed wormhole routing chip creatively exploited the
    combination of asynchronous mode and synchrounous mode, and it is one of
    the several most advanced routing chips in the world.

<li>
    The parallel optimizing compiler of the Dawning-1000 is assessed as one of
    the few most excellent systems in the world by the world famous colleague
    scholars like Arvind in MIT and Gao Guang-Rong in the University of McGill.
    The Paravision, one of the tools on the Dawning-1000, is very advanced in
    the world, on which the person in charge of the technologies for the
    Japanese Fifth Generation Machina Project spend many years but failed.

<li>
    The Dawning-1000 exploits the advanced architecture. Its operating systems,
    software environments and tools, and user interface all use the
    international standards. The overall level of its software is equivalent to
    that of cuerent MPP systems.

<li>
    Testings have shown that the performance of the Dawning-1000 is equal to
    that of famous MPP systems of the same class and scale, and on some
    aspects, eg., the largest problem size it can solve, it exceeds the system
    of the same class and scale.
</ol>

	The table below gives out the highest performance comparation between
the Dawning-1000 and some most advanced MPP systems in the world on Highly
Parallelu Computing Testing. The figures of machines in the table are extracted
from J.Dongarra's technical report "Performance of Various Computers Using
Standard Linear Equations Software" of April 13, 1995. We can see from the
table that the highest performance of the 32-node Dawning-1000 (40 MHZ) is
comparable to that of the Paragon, and superer to that of Delta. The 32-node
Dawning-1000 can solve the linear equations of order 15,000, but the 128-node
Paragon can only solve the linear equations of 12,000. The speed for solving
the linear equations of order 1000 on a single processor of the Paragon (50
MHZ) is 34 MFLOPS, but that on the Dawning-1000 is 35.4 MFLOPS.<p>

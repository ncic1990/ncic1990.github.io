QUICK INSTALL
-------------
   All the files should be located in a directory accessible to
   the web server. In the following I assume that the directory is
   /apache/htdocs/myreview, and that the URL to access the system  
   is http://localhost/myreview 

   First you need to create a MySQL DB as well as a user to access the DB.
   The script CreateDB.sql provides the commands. 

   mysql> source CreateDB.sql

    You can change the DB or user name. Now, check that 
       - DBInfo.php must be writable by the web server
       - the FILES, templates and tmpPdf subdirectories must be  
             executable AND writable. 

    Access to the script
             http://localhost/myreview/Setup.php
    with a web browser: the automatic installation script will be launched.
    Just fill the fields and submit the form.

   If you prefer the manual install, you should report
   the DB and MySQL user infos in the DBInfo.php file which
   contains the necessary information to access the database 
   for PHP scripts. You must also, in a manual install.
   create the schema of the database:

     mysql> source Schema.sql
 
   If you changed the name of the DB, replace 'USE Review' at
   the beginning of the script with 'USE my_db_name'.
   
                         --------------

   OK: it is installed (simple enough?). 
   You should now be able to access and use the system. If you chose
  the manual install, you can connect as an admin
   using the login myreview@lri.fr/08b271. 
   See the doc.pdf for details.
   
GETTING STARTED
===============

 The initial configuration is presented in a form, accessible
 from the administration interface. You should modify the values
 according to your own choices. 

 VERY IMPORTANT: 

    1/ on a production site you must modify the 
       default value of 'passwordGenerator' parameter ('pwd')
        which is used for generating
        passwords (this is done with the automatic install). 
        When you submit the new value, your own
        password is modified, and displayed at the top of the form.

           YOU MUST NOTE AND REMEMBER THIS NEW PASSWORD.

        If you ever forget an administrator password, you
        can use the following script to recover it.

	<?php
	require_once ("Util.php");

	$user = "myreview@lri.fr";
	$db = new BD (NAME, PASS, BASE, SERVER);
	$config = GetConfig($db);
	echo "The password of <b>$user</b> is <b>"
	      . PWDMember($user, $config['passwordGenerator']) . "</b>";
	?>

   2/ The FILES subdirectory MUST be accessible in write mode
       to the web server (uploaded papers are stored there)

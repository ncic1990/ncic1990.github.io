VERSIONS HISTORY
----------------

The system was first used for the ACM GIS conf. in may 2003. It
has been developped, tested and enhanced during the
second semester of 2003, with several beta versions. The first
stable version has been delivered on Feb. 1, 2004

Version 1.0  -- 1 Feb. 2004
  Include all the functionalities described in the doc.   

Version 1.1, March 27, 2004

The SQL interface did not work (missing template) --
There were some problems with Mozilla when displaying the manual
 assignment form --  The directory storing the files can now be changed
            and is hidden to reviewers (new script Download.php)

Version 1.2.0, June, 15, 2004

   PC members and papers can now be removed. This removes all their 
                  associated reviews
         as well.
   Bug fixed in the manual assignment function: when a specific
         topic was selected, either for papers of for reviewers,
      the commit function removed all the previous assignment,
       including those that were not displayed because they
       did not match the topic. 
   The topic selection page gives some feedback 
         whenever a selection is submitted.
   The directory storing uploaded papers can be 
          set up in the configuration form.
   It is now possible to propose several types (formats)
        for uploaded papers. The default is still to accept
        PDF files.

          is more powerful (relies on templates as well).

Note the fact that a reviewer submitted his preferences

Prevent access to Review.php once the review phase is closed.

Add a 'safe mode' option, and allow the removal of papers when not
   in safe mode.

New functions:  - authors rebuttal and evaluation of reviewers  
                - make the Paypal access optional.


When using the "Status of Papers" page to see whether a paper has been assigned to a
reviewer I can easily see whether a paper has been assigned or not. What is not so
easy to see is whether an email has been sent to the assigned reviewer. Only when
the reviewer has rewieved the paper the table entry with "Avg. marks" shows that the
paper has been reviewed and therefore an email has been sent to the reviewer
previciously. But if the reviewer not yet has sent in his evaluation then I can not
tell whether the reviewer has been notified at that moment. Since I don't want to
notifiy reviewers more than once I need to keep a seperate list of which reviewers
has been notified once assigned to certain papers.
 
Is it possible to have an extra column in the table of listed papers which indicate
whether a reviewer has been sent an email or not, when being assigned to a paper but
not yet has sent in his review? Or we can - as in the page for reviewers "Your
Papers" when a reviewer sends in a review the action "Submit my review for this
paper" in red changes to "Update my review" in green - make the "Mail reviewers"
change to something else and in a different color.
